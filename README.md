# GDPR Transparency Tracing

## Overview
This project was developed during particiation of the course
[Privacy Engineering](https://www.ise.tu-berlin.de/menue/lehre/module/privacy_engineering/)
at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin.
The topic of this project was to integrate transparency regarding the usage of
personal data into tracing tools such as Jaeger.
With this it could be achieved that transparency reports respectively privacy
policy documents are more specific and also more accurate.
The idea for this came from [Dr. Frank Pallas](https://www.ise.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/dr_ing_frank_pallas/),
who instructed the Privacy Engineering course, and from
[Dominik Ernst](https://www.ise.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/dominik_ernst/).
This repository contains an initial implementation of this idea.
